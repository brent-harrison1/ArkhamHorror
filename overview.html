          The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties.
          Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol
          supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all
          celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars. Yet a dark
          shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient
          Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the
          gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be
          closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.
          Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror. Will
          they Prevail? Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed
          around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.</p>

          <p>Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one
          of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators
          to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the
          game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills,
          allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean
          out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of
          monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions
          that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the
          Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save
          the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!
